    "How fast and accurately a path planning algorithm can produce a route is a highly sought-after characteristic relevant to many use cases in robotics. Why is that? The higher the planning rate, the better the robot can react to changes in the environment and/or perform in large maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously we saw techniques, such as Dijkstra and A*, which are precise but have high memory requirement and are CPU demanding. Then we turned our attention to the basic RRT implementation, which can be faster but is imperfect, as it creates a zig-zag-like path. Artificial potential fields or virtual potential fields is yet another approach initially developed precisely because it provides a very fast, direct approach for guiding a robot towards a goal while keeping a safe distance from obstacles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea here is to model the map of the environment into a mathematical function f (x, y). It has high values near to obstacles and has its minimum value at the goal location. Once you have constructed such a function, you can use its gradient or slope to build a path to the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to visualize the action of this algorithm is to think of some hilly terrain. The planned path will follow the direction that a ball, placed at the robot's start location, would go. Due to the effect of the slope, the ball will roll \"downhill\" from higher to lower points until it reaches the lowest point.\n",

Conversely, a potential field can be coded as a grid map of size (x_max, y_max) that keeps potential values in each of its grid cells. Then each of its grid cell values represents a potential force for that particular position in the robot's environment. Let's see that in action.\n",

    "1) Expanding the size of map obstacles\n",
    "Typically, obstacles are expanded by at least half of the robot's width. Why? Because a robot's path indicates positions where the center of the robot's base will be moving. By expanding an obstacle by at least half of the robot's width, you avoid the path that gets into the zone of the expanded obstacle, and by implication, the robot's body hits the physical obstacle.\n",

    "5.9   Pros and Cons of Potential Field Methods\n",
    "A notable advantage of potential field algorithms is that they are relatively easy to implement, computationally inexpensive, and run really fast. In fact, they are often incorporated into real-time object avoidance systems running at tens of hertz using the robot's sensor data. However, when using this method for global path planning, the path can easily get stuck and never reach the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "This situation arises when the structure and geometry of the robot environment produce potential fields where the attractive and repulsive forces are canceled out. The following are some examples that typically cause such an event:\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-circular obstacles\n",
    "Very large obstacles of any shape\n",
    "L-shaped obstacles or any dead ends\n",
    "Obstacles close to each other in such a way that the robot/path cannot pass through\n",
    "Narrow passages where the repulsive forces from either side of the passage cancel out the attractive force\n",
    "When the goal is too close to an obstacle\n",
    "In general, you call those map locations critical points. In these places, the gradient is 0 or does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a consequence, the artificial potential fields method is not complete, i.e., there is no guarantee that it will find a path to the goal if one exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some solutions help to overcome critical points. However, they go beyond the conventional attractive potential field algorithm and would exceed the scope of this introductory course.\n",

    "5.10   Summary\n",
    "Below you will find the most important ideas from this unit. Please ensure that you have mastered the basic concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "An artificial potential field is a mathematical description of the robot's environment used to move a robot from a starting position to a goal location without colliding with obstacles\n",
    "A total potential field is the sum of all attractive and repulsive potentials\n",
    "Although there exists a plethora of approaches for calculating attractive and repulsive potentials, the basics are: attractive potentials guide towards the goal while repulsive potentials keep the robot away from obstacles\n",
    "Whichever potential function you choose to use depends on you as the designer of the algorithm considering the map and the particular situation\n",
    "Once you have the total potential function, you can use the gradient descent algorithm to construct a path\n",
    "Additionally, there are a number of parameters that must be considered and properly tuned\n",
    "The main advantage of this algorithm is the speed of computation\n",
    "Accordingly, this method has established itself as one of the most desirable approaches for real-time object avoidance\n",
    "This method is prone to getting stuck at critical points, meaning that in some cases, it will not be able to find a path to the goal\n"
