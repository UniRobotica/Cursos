#When you typed input() you were typing the ( and ) characters, which are parenthesis characters. For input you can also put in a prompt to show to a person so he knows what to type. Put a string that you want for the prompt inside the () so that it looks like this:
# 
# y = input (”Name? ”)
# 
# This prompts the user with ”Name?” and puts the result into the variable y. This is how you ask someone a question and get the answer. This means we can completely rewrite our previous exercise using just input to do all the prompting. 


age = input("How old are you? ") 
height = input("How tall are you? ") 
weight = input("How much do you weigh? ")
print(f"So, you're {age} old, {height} tall and {weight} heavy.")
